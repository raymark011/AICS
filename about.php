                <p style="padding: 15px;text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px">This has been the noble objective of AICS since the very start of its operation way back in 1996. The vision of Mr. Manuel T. Asis, the late Chairman of the Board and President of AICS, was to give the youth an opportunity to learn, and be adept in the field of Information Technology.</p>
                <p style="padding: 15px;text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px">It was in November of 1996 when the first branch of AICS was opened in Fairview, Quezon City. It offered 2-year courses in Computer Science, Computer Technology, and Computer Secretarial, and other computer-related short programs. As the number of enrollees increased, AICS continued to grow as well, opening numerous branches strategically located within Metro Manila and Luzon.</p>
                <p style="padding: 15px;text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px">In the year 2001, AICS ventured further and started to offer B.S. Computer Science in its Caloocan Branch, a continuing degree course for their 2-year Computer Science graduates. AICS Commonwealth followed suit in 2008. To date, AICS hastwo more B.S. degree programs: B.S. Computer Engineering, a continuing course for its 2-year Computer Technology graduates, and B.S. Entrepreneurship, a continuing course for its 2-year Business Information Management graduates.</p>

                <p style="padding: 15px;text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px">True to its vision and mission, Asian Institute of Computer Studies continuously opens its doors to the youth, to every student with the desire to learn and finish an education, particularly in the field of Information Technology.Now, after more than two decades in the industry, the school continues to grow and expand, aiming to reach out to more communities, and offer high-quality I.T. education that is affordable to students from all walks of life.</p>

                <p style="padding: 15px;text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px">AICS upholds its pledge to take part in building a future generation of industry experts, an unending commitment to educate and serve the Filipino youth.</p>
